Here are Shiyun’s week8（26.11.2018 - 02.12.2018）files for CMEE.

The content is again about HPC

The commands run in Bash or other Unix-based env.
Program needed to be installed: Rstudio, python3, ipython3; other packages not specifically used in this week’s practicals (install python3-pip to install some python package)

3 folders included, Code, Result and Sandbox folder.
1. Code folder
   2 R scripts for cluster run, 1 is a test script.
   2 bash scripts for cluster run, and 1 is for test.
   sl518.R is the main script containing my HPC practicals
   sl518.pdf is the write-up part of HPC and sl518.tex and CompileLaTeX.sh are scripts used to generate it.

2. Result folder
   Here are graphs and rda that I generated during HPC.
   Also the zip file contains all the raw data from cluster run

Thanks for reading me! I hope you or myself later on find it helpful~
